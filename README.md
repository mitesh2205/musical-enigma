Flask - Backend, 
React - Frontend

I have used bootstrap package for designing frontend in React.

For proper UI bootstrap package need to be installed in the system.

CLI code:- npm install bootstrap

In react I have used API call, which is created from the backend with spacy a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python. The response is then printed on the react web app.

After installing the UI: 
Run: npm start

I have hosted the flask backend on pythonanywhere for getting the response from the Api call. So, there is no need to run the flask app. Though I have kept the backend code in repository.
